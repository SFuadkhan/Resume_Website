            <h4>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</h4>
            <p>
              Iâ€™m an aspiring Frontend Developer on a mission to craft the
              future, one line of code at a time. With a curious mind and a
              keyboard as my toolkit, Iâ€™m exploring the vast world of tech,
              where creativity meets logic and ideas turn into reality.

            <h4>A Bit About Me:</h4>
            <p>
              Iâ€™m passionate about making the web a more beautiful, functional,
              and accessible space. My journey started with the basics of HTML,
              CSS, and JavaScript, and now Iâ€™m venturing into the realms of
              React, backend magic, and mobile app wizardry. Iâ€™m not just
              learning to codeâ€”Iâ€™m learning to build experiences.

            <h4>What Fuels My Fire: </h4>
            <p>
              When Iâ€™m not working on web projects, youâ€™ll find me cracking open
              a fresh set of algorithm puzzles or untangling a tricky data
              structure problem. For me, these challenges are like mental
              workouts, sharpening my analytical thinking and keeping my brain
              in top form
